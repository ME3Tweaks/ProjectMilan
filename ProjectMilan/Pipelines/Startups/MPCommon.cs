        // 1. This package is overriden via config files for every MP DLC. They always repoint to MPLobby.pcc which exists in every DLC.
        // 2. Some classes in this are overriden by DLC_TestPatch. We must use those classes instead as they will be patched. 
        // 3. A few of these changes were for native code. We will need to analyze how they changed and make adjustments as necessary.
        // 4. For all ported package exports, we should strive to keep the original GUID on the package. If we 
        //         ever make it to actual MP - e.g. replication - this will be vital as that's how Unreal sends package info
        //         across the network. And it's horrible, nearly impossible to debug. Top level packages must use the same GUID
        //         as OT.
